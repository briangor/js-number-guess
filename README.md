# js-number-guess
A simple JS game implementation testing Linear and Binary Search Algorithms for number guesses

For a target in the range of 1 to n, if the target is n then:

solution 1: 
guess each number from 1 to n therefore n steps

optimal solution: 
split the range into halfs until you find the target
